# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-and-music-recommender
This project focuses on developing a dynamic and personalized music recommendation system by integrating speech emotion recognition (SER) techniques. The goal is to automatically detect and classify emotions from speech signals using machine learning algorithms in Python. The extracted emotional features such as pitch, energy, and spectral characteristics from the speech signals are utilized to train classifiers for recognizing emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. The inferred emotional state from the speech signals serves as an input to the music recommendation system. Leveraging ML techniques, the music recommendation system analyzes the user's emotional state and preferences to suggest personalized songs that align with their current emotional state. This integration creates a unique music recommendation experience that caters to the user's emotions, enhancing their engagement and enjoyment. The project utilizes Python programming language and various machine learning algorithms to develop the SER models. Feature extraction techniques are employed to extract relevant emotional features from speech signals, followed by the training of classifiers for emotion recognition. The music recommendation system leverages the emotional state inferred from the SER component, combining it with user preferences to provide accurate and tailored song suggestions. The applications of this project extend to various domains. For instance, it can be used to improve human-machine interaction (HMI) by incorporating emotion-aware responses. It can also aid in speech therapy, assisting therapists in understanding and analyzing the emotional impact of patients' speech. Additionally, sentiment analysis in customer feedback can benefit from SER, enabling businesses to gain deeper insights into customer emotions and preferences. Furthermore, the project offers the potential to analyze and monitor public speaking engagements. By applying SER to speeches, valuable insights can be obtained regarding the effectiveness and emotional impact of public speaking, allowing speakers to refine their delivery and connect better with their audience. I embarked on this project to bridge the gap between speech emotion recognition and personalized music recommendation. With a passion for exploring the potential of machine learning and Python, I aimed to create a dynamic system that automatically detects and classifies emotions from speech signals, extracting relevant features and training classifiers for emotion recognition. By integrating the inferred emotional state with user preferences, my goal was to develop a music recommendation system that leverages ML techniques to provide tailored song suggestions, enhancing the user's emotional experience and engagement. This project not only fulfilled my research interests and entrepreneurial aspirations but also offered practical applications in fields such as human-machine interaction, speech therapy, and sentiment analysis, where the analysis of emotions plays a crucial role.
